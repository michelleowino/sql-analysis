# Background

For this project, I performed data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis, respectively. I designed the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answer questions about the data. 

Below is an analysis of the data. The file of the table schemata, queries and image file of the ERD can be found in the sql-analysis folder.
